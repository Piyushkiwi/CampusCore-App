## üìã Sample Use Case

### Scenario: Mathematics Progress Tracking

1. **Admin Setup**
   - Admin creates "Grade 10A" class
   - Adds "Mathematics" as a subject
   - Registers student "John Doe" and educator "Mrs. Smith"

2. **Educator Workflow**
   - Mrs. Smith logs in and views her assigned class
   - Selects John Doe from the student list
   - Provides feedback: "Excellent progress in algebra. Needs improvement in geometry problem-solving."

3. **Student Access**
   - John logs in to view his dashboard
   - Sees the mathematics feedback from Mrs. Smith
   - Tracks his progress over time

4. **Parent Monitoring**
   - John's parents can remotely access his feedback
   - Monitor his academic progress without visiting the campus
   - Stay informed about areas needing attention

## üìù Important Note

CampusCore is designed as a **student activity and progress tracking platform**, not a traditional management system. 
The focus is on enhancing communication, monitoring academic growth, and facilitating remote oversight of student development rather than administrative management tasks.
